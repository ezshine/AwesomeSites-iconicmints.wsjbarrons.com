You have entered the advertising section.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,770
NFTs have been used to help marketing efforts

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:10,430
from new product launches to customer engagement opportunities.

00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:13,430

00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,440
NFT Taco Art by Taco Bell, 2021

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,680
When you think of Taco Bell and NFTs

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,570
you might not see the direct correlation between the brand and the technology.

8
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:33,770
However, in March of 2021, to celebrate the return of potatoes to the Taco Bell menu,

9
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:41,210
the fast food chain launched a collection of taco-themed NFTs that sold out in 30 minutes.

10
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,880
All proceeds of the NFT sales

11
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:49,010
went on to support the Live Más Scholarship within the Taco Bell Foundation.

12
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,850
The collection was made up of five pieces of art

13
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:57,710
inspired by the Spicy Potato Soft Taco and the Crunchy Taco,

14
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:02,600
with five editions of each piece at the price of a Taco Bell menu item.

15
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:05,360
Each of the NFT purchasers

16
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:08,990
were surprise-gifted with free Taco Bell for a year,

17
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,870
in the form of a $500 eGift card.

18
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,070
Taco Bell’s goal for this NFT activation

19
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:21,050
was to merge their fans’ passion for the brand and food with a digital format.

20
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:23,030
It proved to be successful.

21
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:27,170
In addition to customer engagement and product launch awareness,

22
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:35,090
the NFT collection enables Taco Bell to earn 0.1% of every resale of each NFT.

23
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:41,760
Some of these images have sold on the resale market for upwards of $18,000.

24
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,740
The Heritage NFT Collection by Budweiser, 2021

25
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,830
Another large brand to enter the world of digital assets

26
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:51,430
was Anheuser-Busch InBev’s beer brand Budweiser.

27
00:01:51,430 --> 00:02:03,010
In November of 2021, the beverage giant launched its debut NFT collection.

28
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:11,530
The Heritage NFT Collection is composed of 1,936 unique digital cans

29
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:17,920
representing 1936, the year the first Budweiser can was created.

30
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:24,730
It was made available to consumers of legal drinking age via two different token types at launch

31
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,740
the Core Heritage Cans and the Gold Heritage Cans.

32
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:35,080
Each Heritage Collection NFT is a one-of-a-kind digital asset

33
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:38,440
generated from designs across Budweiser’s history.

34
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,090
Among the 1,936 tokens to be released,

35
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,260
1,900 are Core Heritage tokens

36
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,340
which were each priced at $499

37
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:59,890
and 36 are Gold Heritage tokens, which were each priced at $999.

38
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:04,660
While most companies that use NFTs for marketing purposes

39
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:08,890
give the tokens away for free or at a very low cost,

40
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:16,510
this is an example of a large organization stepping awayfrom the typical NFT strategies,

41
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:20,560
typically centered around product launches or brand awareness.

42
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:25,870
Instead they have leveraged the history of an iconic brand

43
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:31,510
and engaged with super fans who want to own a piece of the brand’s history.

44
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,280
Interestingly enough,

45
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:36,820
Budweiser has since launched other NFT drops

46
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:41,050
and continues to sell the NFTs at a higher price point.
