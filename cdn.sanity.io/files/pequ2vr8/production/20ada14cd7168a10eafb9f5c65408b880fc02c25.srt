Although NFTs are considered unique digital assets,

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,780
some companies have been offering NFTs

4
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:18,740

Moving away from art and into fashion,

7
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:34,040
the fashion industry sees NFTs as a way to certify authenticity

8
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:35,540
and, simultaneously,

9
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:41,750
create the ability for buyers to wear their real-world clothes in the metaverse.

10
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:48,710
Jeff Staple is a streetwear pioneer who launched the Nike SB Pigeon Dunk in 2005

11
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:51,500
that sparked riots in New York City.

12
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:55,400
Mr. Staple had the foresight to see the parallels

13
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,000
between the rise of streetwear and the NFT market.

14
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:05,570
He released a limited edition drop that brought the hype of the sneaker community into the metaverse.

The METAPIGEON K-MINUS dropped in May 2021

17
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,960
and included a virtual chromatic edition of the shoe

18
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:22,520
and a physical version that was delivered to buyers in tandem.

19
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:27,920
Each shoe had an edition of 100 that sold out in minutes.

00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,450
Alongside the fashion world,

22
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:38,480
there has been increased interest from the hospitality industry to leverage NFT technology.

World renowned chefs Tom Colicchio and Spike Mendelsohn

24
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:50,060

27
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:08,210
as well as access to a community of chefs, food enthusiasts and collectors alike.

28
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:14,630
Moving on from the physical versus digital twin aspect that we see with the Jeff Staple sneaker,

29
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:19,670
