00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,910
You have entered the Generative section.

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:12,510
Generative NFT artwork is a work of art that is created in whole, or in part, by an AI algorithm.

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:19,200
The algorithm typically pulls from a set number of features listed to create one unique work,

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,510
without any human assistance.

5
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:26,910
BORED APE YACHT CLUB #8817 - Gold Party Ape

6
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,510
Bored Ape Yacht Club, also known as Bored Ape,

7
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:34,410
is one of the most well known Web 3.0 brands today.

8
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:41,820
This collection of over 10,000 NFTs is individually generated by a computer algorithm

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,770
built by its four founders.

10
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:49,410
As a result of the series’s fame and increased demand, in 2021,

11
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:58,320
the Bored Ape Yacht Club surpassed Cryptopunks as the highest priced NFTs and as of 2022,

12
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,580
the collection’s sales have totaled over $1 Billion,

13
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:08,190
making it one of the highest valued NFT projects on the market to date.

14
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:15,120
This seemingly conventional NFT series grew in popularity due to several factors:

15
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,990
Firstly, unlike most art NFTs,

16
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:26,430
upon purchase of a Bored Ape NFT, the buyer owns the full intellectual property of the artwork,

17
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:31,560
thus creating potential for easy marketing and branding opportunities.

18
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:37,680
Secondly, this NFT series was quickly adopted by celebrities and influencers

19
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,320
and popularized over social media.

20
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,900
Many owners began using their Bored Ape as their profile picture

21
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:53,160
which in turn created a scarcity mindset around the works and turned it into a status symbol.

22
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:02,490
Thirdly, the Bored Ape Yacht Club has resulted in several very popular offshoots

23
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,670
which were only available to Bored Ape owners,

24
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,890
ranging from the Mutant Ape Yacht Club to the Bored Ape Kennel Club.

25
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,490
Due to the huge popularity of this series,

26
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:19,350
Adidas Group purchased a Bored Ape in September of 2021.

27
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:23,580
And the Bored Ape Yacht Club partnered with Rolling Stone magazine

28
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:28,050
to produce a limited edition zine in November of 2021.

29
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:36,630
CHROMIE SQUIGGLE #0, ARTBLOCKS, SNOWFRO, 2020

30
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:41,280
Generative art began in the 1960s but not all creations see the light.

31
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:48,060
Artists cherry pick the best of them from a variety of outputs their algorithm generates.

32
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:55,560
Erick Calderon, artist, developer and tinkerer, known as Snowfro,

33
00:02:55,740 --> 00:03:01,110
created the ArtBlocks.io platform in a way that forces the artist

34
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:04,560
to accept every output their algorithm generates.

35
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:10,410
You can tweak and modify the script and settings until you are comfortable with the result,

36
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,260
but you are not able to discard any.

37
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:18,540
This method elevates the level of algorithmic execution.

38
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:24,210
Pieces are complex and compellingly different but still beautiful

39
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,850
and obviously belong to the same algorithm.

40
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:33,660
The system creates static images, 3D models or interactive experiences

41
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:37,140
that are stored immutably on the Ethereum blockchain.

42
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:46,380
This is Chromie Squiggle #0, made from what one day will be a total of 10,000 mints.

43
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,920
Each is like Snowfro’s personal signature.

44
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,780
It is the largest project currently on the Art Blocks.io platform,

45
00:03:55,110 --> 00:04:00,510
and people can select “live view” to see the colors moving through the Chromie.
