You have entered the Origins section.

00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,450
Before we get into the different industries and themes we see playing in the world of NFTs,

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,170
we wanted to give you some background on its origins.

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:18,330
Here are two examples of some of the first NFTs on the market

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:25,380
that continue to remain relevant and are considered integral to the NFT origin story.

00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:32,549
175 CRYPTOPUNKS WITH MEDICAL MASK, CRYPTOPUNKS, 2017

7
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:43,350
In 2017, two software developers created an experimental crypto art project dubbed CryptoPunks.

8
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:50,580
Using an algorithm, the project generated 10,000 unique digital images.

9
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,230
The images were originally released for free,

10
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,640
but recently some have sold for upwards of $7 million.

11
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,810
CryptoPunks is widely regarded as blockchain’s first foray into cryptoart

12
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:10,490
and the images have garnered a large collector following.

13
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:17,540
What you see here is a grid of the 175 CryptoPunks that exist wearing a medical mask,

14
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:23,180
which shows how quickly art and culture impact each other in the digital world.

15
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,100
CRYPTOKITTIES, 2017

16
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:31,770
Outside of the art market, NFTs have taken off just as fast in the gaming industry.

17
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:38,490
CryptoKitties is a blockchain game developed by Dapper Labs on the Ethereum network.

18
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,200
The game explores the concept of digital scarcity.

19
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:50,250
It allows players to collect, make, purchase and sell virtual cats as NFTs.

20
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:56,360
Once a CryptoKitty is made and minted, it becomes its own NFT,

21
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:58,850
available for trade or sale.

22
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,070
As CryptoKitties breed,

23
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:08,090
their offspring’s appearance and cattributes are determined by each parent’s 265-bit genome

24
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:14,060
and an element of chance, leading to four billion possible genetic variations.

25
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,160
In December 2018,

26
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:21,620
a massive spike in transactions caused a slow down on the Ethereum network.

27
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:23,570
By 2018,

28
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,750
CryptoKitties was spun out from Dapper Labs

29
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:32,480
and made into its own company with an initial investment round of $12million.

30
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:39,510
CryptoKitties range in price from $8 to $140,000.
