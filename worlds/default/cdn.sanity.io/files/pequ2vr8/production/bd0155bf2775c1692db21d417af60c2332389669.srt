00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:07,580
Many people consider NFTs to be new-age digital artworks

3
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:11,720
that are inspired by and created in the 21st century.

4
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:18,350
There are several museums and institutions that create NFTs from historical works of art,

5
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,220
allowing new collectors to own a piece of art history.

6
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:25,130
THE GREAT WAVE by Katsushika Hokusai,

7
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:29,300
LaCollection in partnership with the BRITISH MUSEUM, 2021

8
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,400
The art world was one of the fastest industries to adopt the use of NFTs,

9
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,250
since they serve as a certificate of authenticity for digital artifacts and their scarcity.

10
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:45,500
These unique certificates are attached to digital images.

11
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:51,050
As NFTs are traded and tracked indefinitely through the use of blockchain technology,

12
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:55,040
it is a failsafe way to confirm a piece’s provenance.

13
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,910
With each sale of an NFT artwork,

14
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:04,460
the original artist receives a small percentage of each resale transaction.

15
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:08,480
As a result, as long as the artwork exists,

16
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:13,700
NFTs can enhance the earning power of each piece of art for perpetuity.

17
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:16,400
On September 30, 2021,

18
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:23,690
LaCollection launched its first NFT platform dedicated to museums and art institutions

19
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,820
in partnership with the British Museum.

20
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:30,440
The platform specializes in certifying masterpieces

21
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:36,170
and functions as a certificate of authenticity signed by partner institutions.

22
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,640
The work you see in front of you is “Under the Wave off Kanagawa,”

23
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,060
also known as “The Great Wave” by Katsushika Hokusai.

24
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:47,150
Owned by the British Museum, from the series,

25
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,200
“Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji” made in 1831.

26
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,570
On LaCollection,

27
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,310
patrons are able to buy NFT versions of historical works of art

28
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:01,550
like “The Great Wave” in small editions of 10.

29
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:06,770
The minting of this physical work of art gives the general public

30
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:10,789
an opportunity to own their very own version of art history

31
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:14,270
and creates a passive revenue stream for the museum.
