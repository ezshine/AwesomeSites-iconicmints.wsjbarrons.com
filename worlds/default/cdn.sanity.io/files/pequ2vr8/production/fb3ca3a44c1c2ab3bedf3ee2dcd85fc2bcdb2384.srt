00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,570
In a wildly unregulated market,

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:11,340
there has been a proliferation of unauthorized NFT art.

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,970
These range from people pretending to be an artist,

5
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:20,160
to metaverse designers making big brand products without licensing.

7
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:30,420
While NFTs serve as a certificate of authenticity for digital artifacts,

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,330
hackers have exploited the burgeoning market and those who are not crypto-literate.

9
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:43,890
In 2021, the Serbian artist Milos Rajkovic, also known as Sholim,

10
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:52,530
was caught by surprise when he was alerted by social media that he had an NFT sale of 122 works of art.

11
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,710
It was indeed copies of his work,

12
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:59,340
but it was not Mr. Rajkovic making the sales.

13
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,450
Mr. Rajkovic alerted the platform and the sale

14
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:07,470
was pulled down and he has since sought guidance from a copyright lawyer.

15
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:11,850
Due to the nature of a decentralized crypto market,

16
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:16,830
it may be difficult to identify fraud and move forward with recourse

17
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,180
when the origin point does not have a trusted verification source.

18
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,010
On the flip side,

19
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,800
because records are immutable,

20
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,460
when a proper verification system is in place,

21
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:34,770
it is increasingly easier to track the history of genuine provenance.
