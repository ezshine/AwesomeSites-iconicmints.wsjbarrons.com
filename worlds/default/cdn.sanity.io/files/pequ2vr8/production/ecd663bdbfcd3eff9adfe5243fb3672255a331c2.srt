00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:37,810
In 2021, the film “Zero Contact” launched as an NFT via CurrencyWorks on Vuele,

8
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:43,960
a platform for watching and collecting limited edition films and NFT content.

9
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:52,090
Film NFTs align with the movie memorabilia market and bring this industry into the digital space.

10
00:00:52,720 --> 00:01:00,700
Like all NFTs, movie NFTs can be viewed, collected, bought, sold and traded.

11
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:04,750
Bidding began on September 24, 2021.

The one-of-one Zero Contact platinum edition NFT sold for $56,860

17

the film will be widely released later this year.

Aria, Co-created by Alessandro Michele and Floria Sigismondi for Gucci

19
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:56,200
For its debut NFT, the Italian luxury fashion house Gucci minted an NFT fashion film.

20
00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:03,070
This unique artwork was conceived using digital animation drawn from Gucci Aria,

21
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:06,520
their Spring 2021 campaign film,

22
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:11,290
co-directed by Gucci’s Creative Director Alessandro Michele

23
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:15,970
and award-winning photographer and director Floria Sigismondi.

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,390
It was sold at a special auction at Christie’s

25
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:24,400
and all proceeds of the sale were donated to UNICEF USA.

26
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:30,640
The artwork underlying the NFT speaks to Aria’s overarching message:

27
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:35,950
a yearning to bloom and flourish after the shadow of winter has passed.

28
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,400
Like the Zero Contact NFT film,

29
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:45,970
this film lends itself to the idea of engaging with brand enthusiasts and collectors.
