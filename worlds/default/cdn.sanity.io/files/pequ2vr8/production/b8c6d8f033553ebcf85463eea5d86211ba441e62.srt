You have entered the evolutive section.

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:06,900
NFTs that change and evolve over the course of time.

00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:13,710
Eroding and Reforming Bust of Rome (One Year), Daniel Arsham, 2021

4
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:17,860
In lieu of creating a permanent digital work of art,

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:25,210
the contemporary artist Daniel Arsham created a time-based evolutive NFT

6
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:29,320
that evolves and transforms over the course of one year.

7
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:37,990
Released on May 22, 2021, the work of art will exist until May 22, 2022.

00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:41,470
With Eroding and Reforming Bust of Rome (One Year),

9
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:47,080
Mr. Arsham introduced a concept never before seen in the NFT world.

10
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:53,800
While we see most artists and institutions creating NFTs to exist for eternity,

11
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:58,390
Mr. Arsham approached this project with a finite timeline

12
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:05,230
while also creating an NFT that can ultimately change over the course of its existence.

13
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:12,940
This approach to NFT creation can be utilized for various different applications of the technology,

14
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:17,230
from artwork to play to earn to healthcare and more.
