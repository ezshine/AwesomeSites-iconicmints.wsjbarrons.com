BARRON'S 100 YEARS, 2021

4
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:16,450
In 2021, to commemorate the 100 year anniversary of Barron’s magazine,

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,340
the financial publication minted its first and centennial covers

6
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:24,820
on SuperRare, Ethereum’s art marketplace.

7
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,970
Journalist and historian Kenneth Pringle

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,490
combed the Barron’s archives for stories from the past that are being told once again.

9
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:39,970
For example, we saw a version of the GameStop phenomenon in the 1920s,

10
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:45,190
when a supermarket was being sold short by a number of Wall Street investment firms.

11
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:50,020
Using the research and coverage in Barron's centennial issue,

12
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:55,960
the NFT-minted cover is a visual interpretation of those dualities.

13
00:00:56,470 --> 00:01:02,080
Younger investors are getting into the financial market through new platforms and avenues,

14
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:07,000
and the NFT is just one of those growing markets they’re putting their money behind.

15
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:14,650
WSJ FIRST STIPPLE NFT, 2021

16
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:23,320
The Wall Street Journal’s first stipple (or ‘hedcut’) appeared on its front page in 1979.

17
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:27,370
Named for a drawing technique used to illustrate currency

18
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:31,180
— stippling — the style has become a Journal signature,

19
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:38,800
hand-drawn to this day by a team of artists who spend four to five hours creating each image.

20
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:43,750
At The Wall Street Journal’s Tech Live Conference in October 2021,

21
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:48,430
an attendee won the Journal’s very first NFT-minted stipple.

22
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:52,780
The winner was able to choose from 6 different stipple images

23
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:56,560
and ultimately chose a stipple of a rolodex to be minted.
