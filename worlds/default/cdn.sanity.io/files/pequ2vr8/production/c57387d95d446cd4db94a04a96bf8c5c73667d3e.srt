00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:07,260
The production of an average single-edition NFT

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:12,120
is equivalent to driving a petrol car for 1,000 kilometers,

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:17,820
hence, the environmental impact of NFT minting is something we cannot ignore.

5
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,400
How are people addressing this?

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,920
DEEPER MEDITATIONS #6, MEMO AKTEN, 2018

7
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:30,150
For the first time ever, thanks to NFT technology,

8
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,010
digital artists are able to sustain a living by making art.

9
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:41,430
But we cannot talk about NFTs without addressing its negative impact on the environment.

10
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:49,260
Every NFT that is minted becomes a part of the blockchain network and increases carbon emissions.

11
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,790
Blockchain technology requires a significant amount of gas

12
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,120
as well as several kilotons of e-waste per year.

13
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:58,770
Because of this,

14
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:04,350
people have been advocating for more transparency around the impact of each NFT.

15
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,820
Some suggest that NFTs should provide ballpark figures

16
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:13,050
and advice regarding each NFTs ecological impact

17
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:16,260
and should be made compulsory for all marketplaces.

18
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,920
Those who oppose the compulsory impact information

19
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:24,510
argue that blockchain eliminates traditional banking methods.

20
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:28,440
It doesn’t require offices full of employees and web servers,

21
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,260
which have a larger impact on the environment,

22
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,260
so they believe that it’s simply not necessary.

23
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,760
Creative technologist and doctorate in AI Memo Akten

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,340
is a crypto artist championing a more eco-friendly world for NFTs.

25
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:48,810
He exclusively uses the proof-of-stake consensus algorithm

26
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:54,180
as it requires millions less in energy than the normal proof-of-work algorithm.

27
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:56,700
As a result of its impact,

28
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:01,410
Ethereum also plans to change to the proof-of-stake consensus algorithm

29
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:05,250
to ensure that its algorithms are more environmentally friendly.

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,130
We have selected this piece,

31
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,510
Deeper Meditations #6 from Memo’s 2018 collection,

32
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:20,010
which is a self portrait that explores the minds of an artificial and biological neural network.

33
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,030
Together with many other pieces in this exhibition,

34
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:28,380
we explore how generative art takes on a life of its own.
