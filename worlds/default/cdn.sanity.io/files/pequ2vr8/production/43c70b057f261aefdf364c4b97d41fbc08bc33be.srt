00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,610
You have entered the healthcare section.

00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:07,760
While many connect NFTs to the world of art,

3
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:13,610
another way to leverage this technology can be seen in the healthcare data market.

00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:16,880
DNA NFT sample, Aimedis

5
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,970
Due to the fragmented U.S. healthcare system,

6
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:27,740
NFT technology can help to consolidate and organize a patient’s data across different healthcare providers

7
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:30,890
into one unique and safe digital file.

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,060
The technology would pull a patient’s data across platforms

9
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:39,890
and help the patient and doctors track diagnosis and tests throughout their lifetime.

10
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:41,510
In addition to this,

11
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:46,100
the patient would be able to own their healthcare data,

12
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:51,110
ensuring that medical and healthcare companies are not selling the data.

13
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:57,830
Aimedis, an eHealth platform utilizing blockchain technology, launched in 2020.

14
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:02,000
This healthcare platform combines eHealth applications,

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,560
such as health records, video chat with doctors, appointments, prescriptions, and emergency records.

16
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:17,390
This is all done on a unique medical and scientific-pharmaceutical NFT data marketplace,

17
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:25,400
which displays all relevant operations in a private blockchain, visible and transparent to the patient.

18
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:32,180
Here we see an image of an DNA NFT cover sample which patients

19
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:36,770
and their doctors can access easily through the Aimedis platform.

20
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:39,680
Using blockchain technology,

21
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:46,820
Aimedis users will be able to easily track their medical records across different healthcare institutions.

22
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:50,270
Using NFT technology, Aimedis will offer

23
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:56,660
staking, governance, medical DeFi and social token functionalities.

24
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,600
It is expected that this technology,

25
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,750
will see a longer opportunity for adoption in the U.S.

26
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:06,170
as a result of the country’s convoluted healthcare system.
